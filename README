# There are pre-compiled Linux executables in the bin/ directory for both my
# Google Test suite and the regular (menu-based) solver driver.

// Otherwise, here are build instructions:

// "make" or "make all"
	will construct both Google Test and regular executables

// "make debug"
	will construct only Google Test runner

// "make release"
	will construct only the normal program executable

// "make clean"
	should remove all the cruft from either/both builds

// And finally - the program executable can be run with a command line argument
specifying an Ab matrix data file. It will automatically spit out the 
results of the solver and the relative error. It only runs Jacobi at the 
moment... I should probably allow a 2nd argument so that the user can specify 
a solver.
